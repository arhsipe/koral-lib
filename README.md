## Features

- Reading CSV and Excel files  
- Handling missing data  
- Descriptive statistical summaries  
- Visualizations with bar charts, line plots, and histograms  
- Exporting results to CSV, JSON, and Excel

## Project Structure

```bash
koral/
â”œâ”€â”€ koral/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ io.py         # Functions for data import/export
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core.py       # Basic data processing and analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ viz.py        # Visualization using matplotlib/seaborn
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py   # Initializes the KORAL package
â”œâ”€â”€ exemplo.csv       # Sample dataset for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ test_script.py    # Usage example script
```

---

## Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
```

---

## Example Usage
```python
from koral.io import read_csv, export_csv
from koral.core import clean_data, summary_stats
from koral.viz import plot_bar

# Read dataset
df = read_csv('exemplo.csv')

# Clean data (handle/remove missing values)
df_clean = clean_data(df)

# Get descriptive statistics
summary_stats(df_clean)

# Plot bar chart for specific columns
plot_bar(df_clean, x='Categoria', y='Valor')

# Export cleaned data to CSV
export_csv(df_clean, 'resultado.csv')
```
